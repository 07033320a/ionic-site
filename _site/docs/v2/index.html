<h1 class="title">Ionic 2 Alpha Docs</h1>

<p>Welcome to the preview version of Ionic 2, the next generation of
the Ionic SDK based on Angular 2.</p>

<p>Ionic 2 represents the collective learning and understanding of the Ionic team
over the last two years of building web-based mobile development technology and helping
developers build over <i>800,000</i> mobile apps with the SDK.
More than three months in development, Ionic 2 is finally ready to be used by
an early group of testers.</p>

<p>With Angular 2, Ionic feels and develops much more like a native mobile app. Performance
has improved (dramatically, in some cases), and certain APIs better represent
the architecture and extensibility of their native counter parts.</p>

<p>As you test and try out Ionic, we ask that you submit issues to the <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2">Ionic 2</a> repo. If you don&#39;t have access to the repo, please <a href="mailto:max@ionic.io">let us know</a> and we&#39;ll get you in. We are keeping it invite-only for the short term so we can solidify the foundation before adding the full scrutiny of the broader Ionic dev community.</p>

<p>With that said, let&#39;s jump in!</p>
