<p>On Turning Web Developers into Mobile Developers</p>

<p>As Ionic has grown in popularity and expanded beyond just being a mobile framework for AngularJS, we&#39;ve started to
really understand what kind of developer is drawn to Ionic, and how we can best cater to them.</p>

<p>At the core, Ionic makes it possible for web developers to build compelling mobile apps without having to change careers. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s why we exist.</p>

<p>But when we started Ionic, I wasn&#39;t really sure who we were going after. Initially, I hoped we&#39;d draw native developers away from Obj-c and Android to the web stack. I really wanted to shake up the industry!</p>

<p>We see that happening to an extent which is wonderful, but we&#39;ve also realized that such a change is pretty threatening to native developers. What does the job market look like for native devs when more people can build apps? What happens when businesses realize they are paying too much and taking too long to get to market with apps for major platforms? What happens when the native SDKs are abstracted sufficiently away that it no longer makes sense to work so close to the metal?</p>

<p>I quickly realized that native developers are incentivized to keep the supply for their talents scarce. To make sure that hiring and finding native developers is hard. Of course, they don&#39;t do this maliciously or even consciously, but that&#39;s the nature of job markets. It does seem to explain the vicious backlash against mobile SDKs that are too &quot;alt&quot;.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like a traitor, like we are taking all this hard earned knowlege and experience from being a native developer and bringing it to everyone through the web stack. That we are sabotaging the desirable suppy-and-demand characteristics of the market.</p>

<p>The dirty secret in mobile development is that it&#39;s nearly impossible to find good native developers to build mobile apps. This, despite the fact that many large companies have web developers on staff. We want to empower those developers to build for this exciting platform <em>today</em> without needing much retraining.</p>

<p>To that extent, I think it&#39;s a risky position to be in as a native developer. I&#39;m not sure the market can sustain the cost and hiring challenges. I also don&#39;t like betting against the web because the web stack is not only brilliantly abstract, but widely understood.</p>

<p>In the native development world, too much knowledge is locked up in obscure native APIs, and difficult-to-learn languages. I say that as someone that has built both iOS and Android apps and has written a good amount of C/++. These toolkits are just <em>hard</em> for most developers to master.</p>

<p>The web platform isn&#39;t immune to this. We all know how hard it was to learn Angular 1. There is some pride to having gained that hard earned knowledge. We cling to it and protect it, as if we&#39;d be out of a job if we shared it with anyone else. The possibility that the time invested learning something new might be for nought is frustrating. </p>

<p>We strongly believe the web stack is going to stay the most broadly applicable technology for decades. We think Web Developers will end up being the most versitile developers in the market, and will enjoy long term job stability, growth, and diversity of work because of it.</p>

<p>That means we think one of the smartest decisions aspiring developers can make is learning HTML5, Javascript, and CSS. It runs practically anywhere, and does so in a way that is constantly improving. Ionic wants to be the best option for those web developers, but our true calling is making sure the web development stack can compete with proprietary ones.</p>
