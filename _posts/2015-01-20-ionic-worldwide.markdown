![Ionic Logos](/img/blog/community-header.png)

Our dedicated community helps make Ionic a great hybrid mobile app development ecosystem, for which we’re very grateful. One of the most exciting things we’ve seen happening over recent months is massive growth in our international community. Meetup groups have sprung up in cities around the world, and a few dedicated devs have committed to organizing Ionic groups for entire countries. Other users have presented Ionic in cities around the world. We are humbled and delighted by their enthusiasm and by the time and energy they dedicate to spreading the word about Ionic, and we’re so thrilled to watch our international user base grow in this organic way.

We provide official support to Ionic Meetup groups, starting with cool logos and icons designed by Drifty co-founder and designer extraordinaire Ben Sperry. Groups usually then create Twitter accounts and additional social media accounts as they see fit. 

We help them gain a following by retweeting (and posting on [FB](https://www.facebook.com/ionicframework) and [G+](https://plus.google.com/u/1/b/112280728135675018538/+Ionicframework/posts)) event news, slides, videos, photos, and articles from the [@ionicframework](https://www.twitter.com/ionicframework) Twitter account.

Until now, prohibitive international costs and shipping time have unfortunately prevented us from providing swag, but that will be changing soon! We'll keep you updated in the coming weeks about our new store. In the meantime, we've been encouraging our international Ionic groups to make their own Ionic stickers using the Logo Pack from the footer on our homepage or to order some from our [StickerMule store](http://www.stickermule.com/user/1070630560/stickers).

We’ve also created an [Ionic Presentation](http://ionicframework.com/present-ionic/) that many of our meetup organizers have found useful. Most of them tweak it slightly, and many translate it, but it provides a helpful scaffolding for an introductory presentation about Ionic.

We're always happy to answer any questions from our Meetup groups, and we enjoy being in regular touch with them. We’ve even been known to Skype in to say hello.

Here’s a line-up of the current international Ionic groups (both countries and cities). [Email me](mailto:katie@drifty.com) if you’re interested in organizing a group.
