Hey Ions,

After a hugely successful [ngConf](http://www.ng-conf.org/) last week, the Ionic office is abuzz with Angular 2, and what it means
for Ionic. The number one response from ngConf is that Angular is here to stay, and will only continue to dominate in the future. We are all investing in the right framework.

With that in mind, I want to quickly address the questions we've gotten about Angular 2, and what it means for Ionic.

First of all, we will absolutely be supporting Angular 2, and we will release full Angular 2 support in Ionic v2. In fact, we are already working on it! I don't have a timeline for that (yet!), but chances are it will come earlier than v1 did :)

Next week we are doing an "Angular/Ionic 2 Summit." The Ionic core team will be locking themselves in a room (and we are flying in some remotes!) to go through all the lessons learned over the last year and half. Everything we did right (and *wrong*!) with Ionic v1, and what we will fix in v2.

We are going to become experts in Angular 2, and we are working closely with the Angular team to make sure Angular 2 is an incredible frontend framework on mobile, and that Ionic can build the best mobile framework on top.

With Angular 2, we want to make Ionic faster, easier to use, and more powerful. The new component model makes building components and extending Ionic much easier. Angular 2 apps are easier to write and interact with your data in a more expected way. Learning Angular 2 will be easier, and more developers will be able to work on the code base. A win-win-win-win**N*.

So, yes, Angular 2 support is a 100% for sure. We will have more info when we are ready to release it!

Onward!
