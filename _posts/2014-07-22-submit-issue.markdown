Today I'm excited to introduce a better way for all our awesome community members and contributors to submit issues with Ionic: [Submit An Issue](http://ionicframework.com/submit-issue/).

Many of the issue submissions on GitHub are closely related to existing issues, so to streamline the process and make the interface more user-friendly, we changed our issue submission form.

<!-- more -->

Now, Ionitron will guide you through the process of submitting your issue, problem or bug, and we'll help you find a solution or fix it for you. You'll be able to provide us with some preliminary info, and our new Auto Suggest feature lists out issues to which your problem might be related. If you see a related issue in that list, you can join that conversation and work towards a solution to your problem, instead of creating a duplicate.

We've also improved the UX in general.  The connect to github requirement is now the first step, so there's no surprises after you've taken the time to craft your issue.  Lastly, we've improved the UI with the animated step tracking bar and minor visual improvements.

In the future, we're going to insist all new issues go through Submit Issue page, so we want to start by making sure it's as enjoyable to use as possible.
