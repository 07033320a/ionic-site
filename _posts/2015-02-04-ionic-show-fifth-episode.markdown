### The fifth episode of the Ionic Show is live! 

We took a small break after our last show, but we’ve all been working really hard for the last couple months and have a lot of exciting things to share. Most importantly, we want to give our community a huge shout-out for all your amazing support, hard work, and beautiful apps that have surpassed all of our expectations. 

<!-- more -->

The Ionic community has blown us away with everything we have been able to create in such a short period of time! It is because of the community that we have grown to one of the top 50 most popular open source projects in the world, with over 340,000 apps created across the globe and thousands more being created daily. In fact, we already have more groups around the world than we mentioned at the end of the show!

Here is a quick breakdown of the show:
