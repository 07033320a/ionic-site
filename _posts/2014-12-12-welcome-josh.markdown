I'm really excited to introduce Josh Bavari ([@jbavari](https://twitter.com/jbavari) on Twitter, [@jbavari](http://forum.ionicframework.com/users/jbavari/activity) on the Forum, and [jbavari](https://github.com/jbavari) on GitHub) as our newest Ionic team member!

Josh has spent the last few years diving deep into the open source project, [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/). Starting with version 1.9, he's followed the project from its earlier days, and actively contributes to it as he is one of the maintainers of the [Cordova Plugin Registry](http://plugins.cordova.io/).

Josh has been playing with technology and developing software since his early years. Since joining the professional field in 2007, he's been a part of development projects for companies ranging from start ups, small to medium size businesses, and all the way up to the enterprise level.

Josh finds his passion in developing, helping others by speaking and presenting, and contributing to open source projects - discovering that working on Ionic is a great calling for him in both professionally and lining up with his purpose in the world.

In his free time, Josh trains the gentle art of jiu-jitsu, hiking and biking adventurous trails, snowboarding, tasting many of the finer Rockies beers, and hacking on code.

Expect to see some awesome things from Josh. He joins the team (remotely, out of beaufitul Boulder, CO) to help strengthen the Ionic CLI tooling, integrating additional browsers and conveniences for Ionic developers, helping community members, as well as some of the other back-end integration pieces that help strengthen Ionic. 

Welcome to the team, Josh!
