As the first anniversary of Ionic gets closer, we’ve been reflecting on how things have changed from when [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamdbradley), [Max](https://twitter.com/maxlynch), and I first got together to build a framework that would make it easier for developers to build beautiful, native-quality hybrid mobile apps using web technologies. At the start, we just wanted to create something that <i>we would want to use</i> ourselves (as it turned out, we weren’t the only ones!).

Ionic is almost one year old. As it has grown, at a pace that continues to amaze us, we have expanded the tools and services that go along with it. The [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) and [Creator](http://ionicframework.com/creator/) (which has thousands of Beta invitations going out each day!) are two such examples. Ionic has become so much more than an HTML5 mobile development framework. It is a collection of components, animations, gestures, tools, etc., all targeted at enabling people to build compelling mobile apps that rival native apps’ performance and attractiveness.

At the same time, we’ve also seen an incredible [community](http://forum.ionicframework.com/) form organically alongside us. Projects like [ngCordova](http://ngcordova.com/), an Ionic community effort, continue to grow and evolve. Our new <strong>“ions”</strong> concept, a way to include new components for Ionic as plugins without adding them into the core, will be gaining more resources over the next few months. And with our roadmap heading quickly towards RC 0 in the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing a brand new page transition and animation system, platform design updates, improved scrolling, and more.

Add all of these things up, and suddenly, the term “framework” no longer adequately describes what Ionic truly offers. 

What was once an open source framework is really an open source Software Development Kit that lives inside the greater Ionic ecosystem, which will soon grow to include not only Ionic SDK, the CLI, and Creator, but a [suite of backend tools and services](http://ionic.io/) that integrate seemlessly with the SDK to allow developers and businesses to build, deploy, and manage highly complex mobile apps.

Those tools and services will eventually include products like analytics, A/B testing, and live updating, to name just a few. Many of you have asked how we plan to fund our continued work on Ionic, and if you’re familiar with our [past](http://codiqa.com/) [products](http://jetstrap.com), then you know how we have done things: keep our open source project free and charge for optional backend services and tools that integrate into it. The complete suite of Ionic services will allow us grow our business, and in turn, enable us to keep the SDK and Creator free for anyone in the world to use.

The open source SDK will always be the core of Ionic, and [Drifty](http://drifty.com) will always support it. It’s a priority for us because it enables anyone in the world to access and use the code, which lowers the barrier to entry to mobile development for web developers, career-changing professionals, and members of groups currently underrepresented in tech. We hope that by giving the world Ionic, we will collectively change the future of mobile development.
