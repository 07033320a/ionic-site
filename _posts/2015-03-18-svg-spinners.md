Before releasing Beta 14, we took some time to gather feedback from the Ionic community about how navigation UI should
behave: not just how it should be animated, but how
everything comes together in an app. In Beta 14, we made some major changes to the navigation structure and elements
that follow some already well-established patterns
that can be found in apps across all platforms. We feel these updates will smooth the process of building UI navigation
for your app.
