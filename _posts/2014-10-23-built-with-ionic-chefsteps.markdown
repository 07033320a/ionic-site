“I like to say that it teaches you to be a real chef, ” says Ionic co-founder Max Lynch, a fan of both ChefSteps.com and the ChefSteps app, who worked closely with app developers Andrew Hsu and Nic Cammareta as they built the app. “There are some tutorials that are really serious, making top-quality recipes that you might not ordinarily learn at home, so I think ChefSteps fills a niche for really making you a better chef.”

Developers Hsu and Cammarata are the founders of [Bloom](http://usebloom.com/) and continue to assist ChefSteps with community building. The pair came from a web development background and chose Ionic because they felt it would allow them to create a native-quality multiplatform app quickly. 

“We heard about Ionic via the Hacker News announcement--we started using Ionic less than 24 hours after the initial post,” says Hsu. “There really isn't anything else like Ionic. The only other thing that comes close is Bootstrap, and while both have a focus on design, Ionic goes much further on the behaviors and JavaScript side and focuses on performance.”

As early users of Ionic, Hsu and Cammarata worked closely with Lynch to ensure the app would be an excellent representation of the possibilities of building with Ionic. 

“Max helped us over IRC and email a lot in the early days, as Ionic was still developing,” says Hsu. “Ionic helped us abstract away a ton of the grunt work associated with building a native-quality mobile app on the web--UI, navigation, tabbing, etc. We used a bunch of layout UI elements and the slider box to create a really nice mobile experience for viewing details in a recipe--you're able to initially see an overview video and summary of the recipe, and intuitively slide to get more details and the specific steps.”

Ionic co-founder Ben Sperry is also an avid user of the ChefSteps app. “I’m in love with their app,” Sperry says. “It’s really well designed and simple; you just scroll through different recipes, click on them, and slide over to see a video or a few pictures of whatever it is you’re making, with step-by-step instructions. Most of us here have it.”
