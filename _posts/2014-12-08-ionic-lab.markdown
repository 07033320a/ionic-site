We just added a new feature to the [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) tool that we're calling __Ionic Lab__. Ionic Lab makes it much easier to test your apps on multiple screen sizes and platform types:

We want Ionic to be both a great SDK and a toolchain that gives hybrid developers a leg up on native, and this is one of our first big steps in that direction.

To get started with Ionic Lab, make sure to update to the latest version of Ionic in NPM:

```bash
$ npm update -g ionic
```


We've extended the `serve` command to open the new Lab UI:

```bash
$ ionic serve --lab
```

If you've used the `serve` command before, you'll feel right at home with this one. Just like `serve`, it opens
your app in a browser, but now it shows you what your app will look like on a phone, with both iOS and Android
side by side. 

And of course, it supports Live Reload and all the other goodies we've added over the last couple of months.

We hope you enjoy this new feature. Expect a *lot* more from Ionic Lab in the near future!
