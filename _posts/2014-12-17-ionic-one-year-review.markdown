2014 is coming to a close, and what a year it has been!

It's hard to believe, but Ionic is only one year old. When we launched at the end of 2013 we had no clue
how voracious developers would be to build hybrid apps. We thought we'd have some early adopters trying
out the framework, but we certainly did not expect the massive adoption Ionic has had in just one year!

### By the numbers

In 2014 alone, Ionic has become one of the __top 50__ most popular open source projects on GitHub, with over 12,000 stars. 
There have been over __320,000__ apps created this year alone, with some [great](http://ionicframework.com/blog/built-with-ionic-sworkit/) ones getting featured by both Apple and Google in their respective app stores.

Every month over 50,000 new apps are created, a number that has been growing pretty steadily over the last year.

The forum has seen over 42,000 posts this year, and reachs over 100,000 unique developers a month. It's turning into a great place to get help and collaborate with the Ionic community.

### Ionic 1.0

The next big release of Ionic is slated for early 2015, and we are going for 1.0! 

With beta14 this week, we've made Ionic the fastest and most feature-complete hybrid development framework around.

### Partnerships

We are also proud that Ionic has been integrated into such great tools as [Web Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/whatsnew/), [JBoss](http://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.2.0.CR1.html#ionic), and [Steroids](http://blog.appgyver.com/changelog/steroids/cli/steroids-cli-3-1-23/). There are a few bigger tools on the horizon integrating Ionic, but we can't talk about that just yet!

The Heroku team has also been a big friend of Ionic, creating a [Mobile Template](http://engineering.heroku.com/blogs/2014-10-02-heroku-mobile-app-template) that can be deployed to heroku with one click, and a [full demo](http://heroku.github.io/nibs/) app using Ionic, Heroku, and the Salesforce1 platform.

There are several [starter templates]() from the Firebase team which is quickly becoming the preferred real-time backend for Ionic apps.

Auth0 wrote a great post on using their auth system with Ionic.

### ngCordova

[ngCordova](), our project to wrap the myriad Cordova plugins with clean and consistent AngularJS APIs was launched mid-2014. The idea for ngCordova was proposed by a community member, and the first version was built over a weekend. We've had the incredible fortune of [Paolo Bernasconi]'s great leadership in the project, taking it from a humble 13 plugins to over 55 plugins today! Paolo is one of our biggest heros and we are so thankful to have him.

Much to our surprise the project took off, with over 1200 stars, X contributors, and X pull requests submitted in the last several months. Expect ngCordova to be an increasingly large part of Ionic going forwards.

### Ionic Lab

Just last week we released the first version of Ionic Lab, an extension to our command line utilities that makes the development and debugging process easier, faster, and more fun. Ionic Lab is a small AngularJS app that runs locally to
help you test and develop your Ionic apps.

One nice feature is built in support for our platform-specific styles and features. Develop your iOS and Android app
side-by-side without having to fire up an emulator or test on the device.

It seems Ionic Lab struck a chord with the developer community, and our minds are racing with the potential Ionic Lab has. We can't talk just yet about what we want to do here, but expect Lab to expand greatly in 2015.

### Ionic.io

One big complaint we constantly hear from
Ionic developers is the lack of services targeting hybrid apps. Unfortunately, most mobile development services
target native developers, and often *only* native iOS developers. Mobile service providers have just been oblivious to hybrid development, and we want to change that.

Launching in 2015, Ionic.io will do just that, offering powerful mobile services and tools focused on Ionic apps. Track
usage and analytics, understand the impact of UI decisions, send intelligent push notifications, and update your app without resubmitting to the App Store. Ionic.io will do all of this and more.

Make sure to [sign up for the beta](http://ionic.io/) to get updates on the release!
