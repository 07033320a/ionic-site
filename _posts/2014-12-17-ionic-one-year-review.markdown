2014 is coming to a close, and what a year it has been!

It's hard to believe, but Ionic is only one year old. When we launched at the end of 2013, we had no clue
how voracious developers' appetites for building hybrid apps would be. We thought we'd have some early adopters trying
out the framework, but we certainly did not expect the massive adoption of Ionic that we've seen in just one year!

### By the numbers

In 2014 alone, Ionic has become one of the __top 50__ most popular open source projects in the world, with over 12,000 stars on GitHub. 
There have been over __320,000__ apps created this year alone, with some [excellent](http://ionicframework.com/blog/built-with-ionic-sworkit/) ones getting featured by both Apple and Google in their respective app stores.

Every month over 50,000 new apps are created and over half a million unique developers visit the Ionic website for documentation and to read articles about hybrid apps and the broader mobile dev ecosystem on this blog.

The [forum](http://forum.ionicframework.com/) has seen over 45,000 posts this year, reching over 100,000 unique developers a month. It's turning into a great place to get help and collaborate with the Ionic community.

And last but not least, the [#ionic](http://) IRC room on Freenode has nearly 100 active users at any given time! Having an official single-hash room on Freenode was a personal dream of mine ever since I started using IRC 15 years ago.

### Ionic 1.0

The next big release of Ionic is slated for early 2015, and we are going for 1.0! 

With beta14 this week, we've made Ionic the fastest and most feature-complete hybrid development framework around. Drawing on lessons learned from build native apps, we've added features like view caching, dynamic platform transitions and UI adaptation, among hundreds of bug fixes and improvements.

This will be the last beta release. After the holidays, we will be releasing rc0 and moving towards 1.0 in early 2015.

### Ions


We quietly released a very early preview of what we are calling [Ionic Ions](http://ions.ionic.io/), a set of addons and widgets that give your Ionic apps special powers.

As we've grown Ionic, we've created addons like [Shrinking Headers](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-ion-header-shrink), [Frosted Glass](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-ion-frost), and [Tinder Swiping Cards](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-ion-tinder-cards). We realized early on that these add-ons don't make sense as part of the core Ionic project, but are an integral part of the entire Ionic ecosystem.

We want to encourage Ionic developers to create reusable widgets and we will be making it easy to submit them to the official Ions repository soon.

You can test out Ions today by using the `$ ionic add ION` command, and we will have a lot more info on this in the future!

### Partnerships

We are also proud that Ionic has been integrated into such great tools as [Web Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/whatsnew/), [JBoss](http://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.2.0.CR1.html#ionic), and [Steroids](http://blog.appgyver.com/changelog/steroids/cli/steroids-cli-3-1-23/). There are a few bigger tools on the horizon integrating Ionic, but we can't talk about that just yet!

The Heroku team has also been a great friend of Ionic, creating a [Mobile Template](http://engineering.heroku.com/blogs/2014-10-02-heroku-mobile-app-template) that can be deployed to Heroku with one click and a [full demo](http://heroku.github.io/nibs/) app using Ionic, Heroku, and the Salesforce1 platform.

There are several [starter templates]() from the Firebase team; Firebase is quickly becoming the preferred real-time backend solution for Ionic apps.

Auth0 wrote a great post on [using their auth system with Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/blog/authentication-in-ionic/).

### ngCordova

[ngCordova](http://ngcordova.com/), our project to wrap the myriad Cordova plugins with clean and consistent AngularJS APIs was launched mid-2014. The idea for ngCordova was proposed by a community member, and the first version was built over a weekend. We've had the incredible fortune of [Paolo Bernasconi](https://twitter.com/paolobernasconi)'s great leadership in the project, taking it from a humble 13 plugins to over 55 plugins today! Paolo is one of our biggest heros and we are so thankful to have him.

Much to our surprise the project took off, with over 1300 stars, 57 contributors, and 250 pull requests submitted in the last several months. Expect ngCordova to be an increasingly large part of Ionic going forwards.

### Ionic Lab

Just last week [we released](/blog/ionic-lab/) the first version of Ionic Lab, an extension to our command line utilities that makes the development and debugging process easier, faster, and more fun. Ionic Lab is an AngularJS app that runs locally to
help you test and develop your Ionic apps.

One nice feature is built in support for our platform-specific styles and features. Develop your iOS and Android app
side-by-side without having to fire up an emulator or test on the device:

It seems Ionic Lab struck a chord with the developer community, and our minds are racing with the potential Ionic Lab has. We can't talk just yet about what we want to do here, but expect Lab to expand greatly in 2015.

### Ionic.io

One big complaint we constantly hear from
Ionic developers is the lack of services targeting hybrid apps. Unfortunately, most mobile development services
target native developers, and often *only* native iOS developers. Mobile service providers have just been oblivious to hybrid development, and we want to change that.

Launching in 2015, Ionic.io will do just that, offering powerful mobile services and tools focused on Ionic and hybrid apps in general. Track
usage and analytics, understand the impact of UI decisions, send intelligent push notifications, and update your app without resubmitting to the App Store. Ionic.io will do all of this and more.

Make sure to [sign up for the beta](http://ionic.io/) to get updates on the release!
