We are excited to be sponsoring a $500 cash prize for the best Ionic post submitted to AirPair’s $100K developer writing competition!

AirPair has released cool features that allow authors and readers to collaborate on posts, just like normal code, via forks and pull requests. Over the next 12 weeks, you can win your share of $100,000 in prize money for the best tutorials, opinion pieces, and stories about using Ionic in production.

Have you used Ionic in a way that you are proud of? Have you learned something you feel others would benefit from? How have you combined it with other APIs to get the job done? The average post published on AirPair in January was read 15,000 times, so this is a great way to share the cool things you’ve made with fellow developers.

Submit your posts [here](https://www.airpair.com/100k-writing-competition).
