<h1 class="title">Using Ionic Plugins</h1>

Great Ionic apps don't just live in a web view in an app, they embrace the entire
native environment they run on. They take pictures, track location, integrate with
bluetooth devices, and power Watch apps (among many other things!).

Through Ionic 2's sister project [ngCordova 2](http://ngcordova.com/), the full
native power of the device is available to you.

Follow the Native tutorials on the left to learn how to interact
with the underlying platform of the device in a cross-platform way, all through
javascript.
