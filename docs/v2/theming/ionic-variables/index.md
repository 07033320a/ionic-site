<h1 class="title">Ionic Sass Variables</h1>

There are many variables you can override with Ionic. The below is a list of all of the variables which use the `!default` flag. This means that you can change the value of any of these, as long as you do it before the import of Ionic's Sass files.

<em>Note: We do not recommend changing the value of any of the variables in our Sass files directly. When a new version of Ionic is released, these files will be updated and you will lose any changes you've made to them.</em>
