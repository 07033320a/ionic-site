<h1 class="title">Getting Started with Ionic 2</h1>

Like Ionic 1, Ionic 2 apps can be quickly created from the Ionic CLI or GUI tool, or built and tested right in the browser.

To install the Ionic SDK and create Ionic 2 projects, we need to install the latest alpha release:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@alpha
```

(Note: do not type the dollar sign, that is a placeholder for your shell prompt).

For more installation info, follow the official [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) guide. This walks you through
installing node, npm, cordova, and Ionic.

Once that's done, create your first Ionic app:

```bash
$ ionic start cutePuppyPics --v2
```

To run our app, just run

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

And we can play with it right in the browser!
