<h1 class="title">Getting Started with Ionic 2</h1>

The fastest way to get started with Ionic 2 is to download and run the first
official [starter project](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-starter).

Once the repo is downloaded and cloned, we can try it out (make sure to
  install Node.js and gulp first):

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g gulp (if you haven't installed gulp)
$ cd ionic2-starter
$ npm install
$ gulp watch
```

Then, open up `http://localhost:8100/` in your browser to get your first
glimpse of an Ionic 2 app:

What you see might vary depending on changes we've made to the v2 starter.
