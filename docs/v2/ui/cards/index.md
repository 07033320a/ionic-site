<h1 class="title">Cards</h1>

Cards are a great way to display important pieces of content, and are quickly emerging
as a core design pattern for apps.

Cards are primarily a CSS component. To use them, follow this structure:

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-header">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>

  <div class="card-content">

    "A great photograph is one that fully expresses what one feels, in the deepest sense, about what is being photographed." - <i>Ansel Adams</i>

  </div>

  <!-- Images stretch the full width -->
  <img src="http://ionic-io-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/p.jpg">

  <div class="card-footer">
