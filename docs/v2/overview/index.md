<h1 class="title">Ionic 2 Alpha Docs</h1>

Welcome to the preview version of Ionic 2, the next generation of the Ionic SDK based on Angular 2.

Ionic 2 represents the collective learning and understanding of the Ionic team over the last two years of building web-based mobile development technology and helping developers build over *800,000* mobile apps with the SDK. After more than three months in development, Ionic 2 is now ready to be used by an early group of testers.

With Angular 2, Ionic feels much more like a native mobile app. Performance has improved (dramatically, in some cases), and certain APIs better represent the architecture and extensibility of their native counterparts.

As you test and try out Ionic, we ask that you submit issues to the [Ionic 2](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2) repo. If you don't have access to the repo, please [let us know](mailto:max@ionic.io) and we'll get you in. We are keeping it invite-only for the short term so we can solidify the foundation before adding the full scrutiny of the broader Ionic dev community.

With that said, let's get started!
