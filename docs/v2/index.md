#Ionic 2

We designed Ionic to be as natural as possible for a web developer to build great mobile apps for the app store. That means we focus on taking the standard HTML, CSS, and Javascript, just like you'd use to build a website, and we help you turn it into mobile magic. These technologies have served developers well for the last twenty years. We think that makes them a pretty great bet for the next twenty.
