Welcome to the preview version of Ionic 2 &mdash; *the next generation of the Ionic SDK based on Angular 2*.

Ionic 2 represents the collective learning and understanding of the Ionic team over the last two years of building web-based mobile development technology and helping developers build over <i>800,000</i> mobile apps with the SDK. After more than three months in development, Ionic 2 is finally ready to be used by an early group of testers.

The performance of Angular 2 has improved dramatically. As a result, Ionic 2 feels much more like a native mobile app.

As you test and try out Ionic, we ask that you submit issues to the [Ionic 2](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2) repo. If you don't have access to the repo, please [let us know](mailto:max@ionic.io) and we'll get you in. We are keeping it invite-only for the short term so we can solidify the foundation before adding the full scrutiny of the broader Ionic dev community.

With that said, let's jump in!
