#Welcome

Welcome to the preview version of Ionic 2 â€” the next generation of the Ionic SDK. Ionic 2 represents the collective learning and understanding of the Ionic team over the last two years building web-based mobile technology and helping developers build over 1,000,000 mobile apps with the Ionic SDK.

With Angular 2, Ionic apps are considerably more performant and easy to build. On top of that, we've built a totally new navigation and cross-platform design architecture to make it easy to build apps that are as dynamic and customizable as the best apps in the app stores (many of which are Ionic apps themselves).
